			<p>This course was well designed and engaging to complete. The instructors, Caroline and
			Sarah, helped guide me through understanding not only how to use Git and GitHub for
			version control for solo and collaborative projects, but also the <i>importance</i> of using
			some type of version control.</p>

		<div class="rcorners">
			<p>Throughout the course I wrote prompted reflections on what were were learning
			and the merits of various aspects of the version control software. Here are some important
			excerpts I feel exemplify my learning:</p>
			
			<blockquote>
				<b><span style="font-size:18px; font-style: normal; LINE-HEIGHT:24px;">
				How using version control allows us to be more confident and innovative
				</b></span>
			<br>
				<span style="font-size:14px; LINE-HEIGHT:18px;">
				By using Git, we obtain freedom to try big changes without worrying about
				how to revert back to previous versions. This way we don't have to worry about
				breaking our code. Also, if we do break our code and don't (yet, perhaps) know
				how to fix it, we can revert to a previous state and make a new branch, leaving
				the broken code wait for us until we are ready to deal with it.
				This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THmul1MlYvI&feature=youtu.be">
				interview from Lewis Kaneshiro</a> helps explain how Git has helped him become
				a prolific programmer. I'm honestly excited to use Git in my personal projects and am
				excited by the idea of job in a collaborative enviroment that utilizes version control.
				</span>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>
			While this is exciting and Git has great power, learning to use Git 
			is not a trivial experience. Below I highlight some of the tactics for
			using Git commands to identify when a bug was introduced into a program
			and how to identify the lines of code that fix it.
			</p>

			<blockquote >
				<b><span style="font-size:18px; font-style: normal; LINE-HEIGHT:24px;">
				How git commands "git log" and "git diff" to view the history of files
				</b></span>
			<br>
				<span style="font-size:14px; LINE-HEIGHT:18px;">
				By using the command <mark><code>git log</code></mark> you view the committed changes that have been
				logged. Each log contains a comment describing what changed in that commit. If you think a certain
				commit may have introduced a bug into your program, you can "step into" certain log states by using 
				the <mark><code>git checkout ID</code></mark> command where ID is the commit ID from the commit log.
				If you are interested in what specific code changes during a commit, you coukd
				compare it to the previous commit. To do this you use the <mark><code>git diff</code></mark> command along with
				the IDs provided by the log. Note that in your command prompt, copy and paste hotkeys may not
				be the same as what you are used to! (apparently it's crtl/shift + ins in my Git Bash MINGW64 command prompt).
				</span>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>Expanding on the functionality of Git, we learned the nuanced differences
			between our working directory, Git repository, and the staging area. At first
			one might think, "Is it really necessary to have these different spaces? Why
			not just automatically update my repository when I make a change in the working
			directory?" Simply put, the more control we have the more flexibility we have in
			our work flow. What would happen if Git committed a change in the middle of
			a coding line? It's best for us to commit our own changes at meaningful points.</p>
			
			<blockquote>
				<b><span style="font-size:18px; font-style: normal; LINE-HEIGHT:24px;">
				Repository, working directory, and staging area,<i> oh my!</i>
				</b></span>
			<br>
				<span style="font-size:14px; LINE-HEIGHT:18px;">
				The working directory contains the physical files on your hard drive. The repository
				contains the data files for the history of commits/branches.
				The staging area lets you take items that you have changed in your working
				directory and then commit changes. The staging area lets you
				commit any number of files (one at a time or multiple files together) depending on
				which files you are ready to commit, allowing for flexibility.
				<br><br>
				
				<b>Note on Commands:</b><br>
				When there no changes to stage, the staging area contains
				the most recent commit. This helps us utilize these commands:
					<ul type=none>
						<li><mark><code>git diff</mark></code> compares the working directory to the staging area</li>
						<li><mark><code>git diff --staged</mark></code> compares the staging area to the most recent commit</li>
						<li><mark><code>git diff ID1 ID2</mark></code> compares the two commits with ID1 and ID2</li>
					</ul>

		<h3>Version 1 Normal Mode</h3>
			<p>One of the tasks for the Version Control (Git/GitHub) course I took through
			Udacity was to search the log of a video game to find when an bud was
			introduced. Then use diff to see what the buggy code was. The version below
			is the final version we created in normal mode:</p>
			<p align="center"><iframe src="asteroids-normal/index.html" width="800" height="580" style="background-color: white;"></iframe></p>
		</div><br>

		<div class="rcorners">
		<h3>Version 2: Hard Mode</h3>
			<p>To change the game difficulty, we were guided to the location
			in the file where the number of fragments an asteroid breaks into
			upon being shot was defined. I decided to make my hard mode have the
			asteroids break into 5 pieces. Also, I added difficulty by making the
			boulders move at a higher speed after breaking than in normal mode. This
			was not discussed in the Udacity course but the programmer clearly
			labeled the variables so it was easy for me to figure out how to change this:</p>
			<p align="center"><style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="asteroids-hard/index.html" width="800" height="580" style="background-color: white;"></iframe></p>
		</div><br>

		<div class="rcorners">		
		<h3>Version 3: Easy Mode</h3>
			<p>To make an easy version of the game, switched it so each asteroid
			broke into two fragments when hit with a bullet. I also made the fragments
			move slower than in normal mode. Lastly, I removed the delay from the bullet
			trigger so you can shoot a stream of bullets. I think spinning and flying around
			while shooting creates some awesome visuals. The velocity of the bullets leave relative
			to your velocity. Try speeding up and shooting/forward backwards to see what I mean:</p>
