<h1>The Day of the interview</h1>
<em>April 27, 2018 at 9:32pm</em>

<p>It's interesting how the more advanced the position, the more in depth the interview the process is. It's definitely an exciting roller coster, reminiscent of applying and getting hired for my academic job. Here's been the process thus far:</p>

<blockquote><h3>30 minute prescreen with HR +<br /> 1hr conversation with the hiring manager <br />+ 2.5 hour onsite interview </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>on the final step: take home project</em></blockquote>

<p>I'll get to the take home project in a second, but first I want to talk about the interview experience.</p>

<p>Every step along the way has left me more jazzed about this company and specifically to work with the team I interviewed with. They have come highly reviewed by a formidable member of the Python Meetup I attend. They have progressive and streamlined programming workflow. The enviroment is very social and collaborative. I think this would be a great place for me to start my career.</p>

<h2>Escaping Imposter's Syndrome</h2>

<p>Then the nagging thought enters, <em>What can I offer them?</em> Thankfully my work to escape my patterns of dispaging self doubt, I think I can say confidently that I can be a contribution to this team.</p>
<p>My lack of experience can actually be an asset to the team. With a fresh perspective I will be able to evaluate why we are doing things the way they are done, without having been influenced by years of "this is just how it's done". I also believe coming to the game late, I will motivate me to work harder long term to try to outrun the shadow of not having a history of programming.</p>
<p>On a similar note, my previous lives aid me in approaching problems with a unique perspective. For many years I looked at problems through and engineer's eyes, "How do we best approach this problem and optimize the solution?" Then more recently I've learned a lot through my two years as an instuctor that will translate towards any position I hold - including this one.</p>

<h2>Entering the Interview</h2>
<p>I think the most notable aspect of the whole process has been the focus of the department on making sure they hire someone who is the right fit for the team dynamic. I have found that it is really important to get along with the people you work with, and I surely want people to get along with me!</p>
<p>Alas, there is only so much social interaction you can gleen from a couple hours of social interaction. We made good progress right off the bat with one of the team members asking:</p>

<blockquote>
Say you are working with a team member on some code and you have a disgreement. And say you absolutely know you are right. What do you do?
</blockquote>

<p>I talked about finding an impartial third party to bounce the idea off of. I also thought that the problem could be taken to some google searches to see if there's best practices out there. The conversation then evolved into discussing the cost-benefit analysis of getting your way versus letting it go. What's the worst that would happen if you don't get your way? If user data or efficiency is compromised, then it would be worth sticking to your guns.</p>

<p>This leads into my evolving philosophy around being objective in my approach to work. It's so easy to get personally wrapped up </p>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
The final steps for the final interview is to complete a homework assignment. The assignment is to make a twitter-like app with Django. Here are the specifications:

<ul>
  <li>Users must create an account to add a new message</li>
  <li>Message Specifications:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>limit message characters to 140</li>
    <li>If a message contains a url to an image, show the image on the page instead of the URL</li>
    <li>Do not count characters that are part of a URL (for links or images)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Users can edit or delete messages they created</li>
  <li>Users can filter to list messages:
    <ul>
      <li>They have authored</li>
      <li>Other user's messages</li>
      <li>All messages from all users (normal view?)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Users can search for a message</li>
  <li>Users can send private messages to each other</li>
</ul>

<p>I was informed that I do not need to complete every specification, but I can pick and choose which features I want to focus on. I also am supposed to imbue some of my personality into this - to let them get to know me personally additional to my technical skills. I'll have to have some fun with the front end display and the message string!</p>

<h2>Beginning to Plan</h2>

<p>As conveyed in my interview, my MO for development has become "google search it to figure it out." A blog post I came along was from Chris Bartos titled <em><a href="https://chrisbartos.com/articles/how-i-learned-django-in-3-months/">How I learned Django in 3 Months</a></em>. He discussed that turning to tutorials and online classes to learn whole heartedly is not a long term strategic approach. He says "tutorials are hand holders... Just like you can’t learn to stay up on a bike with training wheels, you also can’t learn to make web applications in Django without putting down the tutorial."</p>

<p>Chris claims the only way you truly learn to program with Django is to get your hands dirty, digging into the documentations, and starting to build your project piece by piece.</p>

<h3><em>Great advice Chris. I get it. But I don't have 3 months to learn Django. I need this app built in a week!</em></h3>

<p>So I will take a middle ground approach. I have found a course or two (and some tutorials and some github repos) that will help me go through the motions with this projects, but I also think it's essential for me to think through this process as I go through it - not to just follow a tutorial "type this, now do that" style.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to getting going on this, but for tonight this is all I have in me. Tomorrow I will be meeting with my Python and R group. I look forward to sharing my news with them about continuing the interview process and seeing what advice they have on moving forward with this project.</p>
