<p>Alright, time to reevaluate the situation:</p>
<h2>Specified Capabilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Completed:</strong><em>Users must create an account to add a new message</em></li>
  <li>Message Specifications:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Completed:</strong><em>limit message characters to 140</em></li>
    <li>If a message contains a url to an image, show the image on the page instead of the URL</li>
    <li>Do not count characters that are part of a URL (for links or images)</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Completed:</strong><em>Users can edit or delete messages they created</em></li>
  <li>Users can filter to list messages:
    <ul>
      <li>They have authored</li>
      <li>Other user's messages</li>
      <li>All messages from all users (normal view?)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Users can search for a message</li>
  <li>Users can send private messages to each other</li>
</ul>

<p>So in actuality I only got one more feature implemented. It was a fun process though, learning how to allow users to edit and delete previous posts. I still am working on enabling comment edits, so let's take inventory of what's left on the sprints</p>

<p>Side note: I figured out how to get the post that the commenter is posting on onto the comment page. Post was already save with the <code>get_object_or_404</code> function, I just needed to load in on the template with <code>{{ post }}</code>.</p>

<p>Alright, we've got some work to do!</p>

<h2>Sprint 6: Use CSS to make things look nice</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Center the "new post" and "new comment" dialogue box</li>
  <li><strong>Completed:</strong><em>Add menu items that change whether you are logged in or not</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Not logged in: only "About", "Login", "Create Account"</li>
    <li>Logged in: "Create Post", "About", "Account", "Logout"</li>
  </ol></em>
  <li><del>Create</del> Finish about page that has more info</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>A short overview of what I've done with this project and why</li>
    <li>Access to these notes to help the IMT team look through the process I took in creating this</li>
    <li>Contact info for me</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p><strong>Side Quest:</strong></p>
<p>I'm still working on getting the redirect URL to load at the post you were commenting on, or the post you just made, etc. It's annoying to edit a comment and then have to scroll back down to where it was located. It's a little feature but it would be nice. I wrote about this some yesterday and may have found a fix <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11165267/django-redirect-with-anchor-parameters"></a>here, with a reverse lookup method as I suspected.</p>
<ol>
  <li>There seems to be a few different options for code. The version I will use is: <code>return redirect('{}#first'.format(reverse('main.views.home', kwargs={'home_slug':slug})))</code></li>
  <li>I'm not completely certain why we use 'mains.views.home' instead of the URLconf name, but maybe they didn't use a name.</li>
  <li>I'm going to do this first with <code>add_comment_to_post()</code> and see how it works </li>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> Don't forget to import functions from the appropriate module! >_< (<code>from django.urls import reverse</code>) </li>
  <li>After a bit of trial and error I was able to get this to work, however I've noticed that since my navbar has a fixed position, my anchors appear to be a bit lower than where I want them.</li>
  <li>I figured to fix this I would need JavaScript. With some google searching I was able to find a way to scroll up X pixels when jumping to a bookmark link.</li>
  <li>This workaround only works if (1) the page was loaded with a #bookmark url (e.g. when redirected after commenting on a post) or (2) when a link is clicked on inside of the page leading to this hashtag. I would need to dig into the JS to figure out how to make it work if someone manually changes the URL while already on the page. If the person is that tech savvy they can just scroll up on their own ^_^</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sprint 7: Allow users to delete & edit posts they have created</h2>
<p>This sprint is complete except for needing to add the edit comment feature. I had issues with calling the post pk when making a comment, so I was getting lost on which pk I was trying to reference. So, I decided to change everything to be just about the comment (pk, form, etc). I can call the <code>{{ comment }}</code> and display the comment_text on the website for edit comment, but I can't get the form to fill as an instance of the comment and I can't edit the comment. For now I will just disable the button and only have delete comment as an option. I will see if I can troubleshoot this with someone.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
  <p>Breakdown of future work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sprint 8: Load IMTwitter onto Digital Ocean for sharing</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm excited to do this. I'm curious how this process works. Is it the right time to execute though considering it's not even required for submission?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Sprint 9: Create URL recognition in post/comment & load image if image URL is provided</li>
    <li>Sprint 10: Create views to sort posts and comments by author</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I don't think creating the view will be that much of a challenge. I just need to specify <code>post.user = "X"</code> where x is the current user or whatever user they are looking to find.</li>
      <li>Method 1: Have a link on each user's name that will take you to a page that has posts just by that user. </li>
      <li>Method 2: Have a dropdown menu at the top with all the users and have the ability to select what user you want to see posts from.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Sprint 11: Add search feature</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Additional to figuring out how to do this, I need to figure out how it will function. Are we searching just post and comment text and returning posts and comments with that text in it?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Sprint 12: Add capabilities of private messaging other users</li>
    <li>Sprint 13: Add advanced user function like change password/reset password</li>
  </ul>
</h3>

<h2>Sprint 10: Create views to sort posts and comments by author</h2>
<p>Method 2: Have a dropdown menu at the top with all the users and have the ability to select what user you want to see posts from.</li>
<ol>
  <li>Access users from: <code>from django.contrib.auth.models import User</code></li>
  <li>Access users list with: <code>widget=forms.Select(choices=User.objects.all())</code> </li>
  <li>I will use HTTP GET (template side) because I will not be altering the DB with this form (or will I use POST to query the BD? My limited training says a search is just "GET")</li>
  <li>Create a view for the form</li>
  <li>I've tried to do some troubleshooting with this. I have created a form that had the usernames of all users as a dropdown menu, however when I tried to call this form using {{ formname.as_p }} nothing showed up. Maybe it's because I need to create this from the model? I shouldn't need to because the model is already created..</li>
  <li>I've made some headway on sorting by username with using REGEX in my URLconf to call the user in the view to be sorted by. I used the following URLconf <code>r'^posts/(?P<username>[-\w]+</code> I'm hoping I used the right REGEX at the end </li>
</ol>
