<h1>Day 1 Recap</h1>
<em>April 28, 2018 at 10:16pm</em>

<p>What a day! Let's review what we've accomplished so far:</p>
<h3>
  <p>Completed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sprint 1: Create the project and app.</li>
    <li>Sprint 2: Create database, model and migrate</li>
    <li>Sprint 3: Create the login/logout dynamics</li>
    <li>Sprint 4: Create the new account user interface</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For another day:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sprint 5: Create the models, templates and views for posts and comments</li>
    <li>Sprint 6: Use CSS to make things look nice</li>
  </ul>
</h3>

<p>I feel pretty proud and accomplished! I definitely think the <a href="https://chrisbartos.com/articles/how-i-learned-django-in-3-months/">blog by</a> Chris Bartos helped set my perspective well. It's best to tackle learning Django (or anything) by putting yourself slightly outside of your comfort zone. Also the availability of tutorials and classes online is great, but following them directly can be a crutch. It was a great experience using the tutorials to extrapolate what to do with the app I am creating. I'm honestly suprised, yet quite pleased that everything worked out so well.</p>
<h3>Confusions Left</h3>
<p>I still am trying to wrap my head around routing urls to the app urls.py file and where templates need to be created. Because I was piecing together my project from multiple tutorials I ended up putting my templates in various locations and they all seemed to work. Maybe Django is just robust enough</p>
<p>I think the biggest uncertainty is how the forms are populated for Login and Signup. I think that Django just knows what to put there based off their location, HTML name, and objects. One of the tutorials mentioned changing the signup interface being doable but outside of the scope of the tutorial. We'll see if I get there.</p>
<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
<p>Although I've made good headway in this project, I may take a step back and internalize what I've created. One option would be to take this <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Django-tutorials/Welcome/594454/600921-4.html?autoplay=true">course on lynda.com</a> specifically about building a social network site with Django. The course will help fill in the gaps and solidify the knowledge about the procedure I went through today. I can imagine it will also give me ideas about how to move forward with creating templates and views for the posts and comments.</p>
<p>For the rest of tonight I might mess around with a bit of bootstrap on my website. I really love pure CSS (see <a href="http://mbeche.github.io">my original portfolio</a> for an example of one of my first CSS creations or <a href="http://hippo.mdevstix.com">this wordpress</a> theme I created as a project), but I have been wanting to get to know bootstrap a bit better. This would be a good opportunity for that!</p>
