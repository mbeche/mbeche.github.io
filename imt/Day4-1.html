<h1>Day 4: Extending forms to posts and increasing functionality</h1>
<em>May 1, 2018 at 2:53pm</em>

<p>Yesterday was an exciting day. I was able to use some advanced tutorials to figure out how to make a form to comment on posts. It had it's challenges since our models weren't completely the same and the tutorial used an old version of Django, however I enjoyed the challenge. Today I will create a form for creating new posts. Then I will work towards editing and deleting posts. </p>
<h3>
  <p>Breakdown of future work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sprint 5b: Add the capability to make a new post to the social media website.</li>
    <li>Sprint 6: Use CSS to make things look nice</li>
    <li>Sprint 7: Go back and fill in some capabilities that I should add in: deleting a post, editing a post, etc</li>
  </ul>
</h3>

<h2>Sprint 5b: Add the capability to make a new post to the social media website.</h2>
<p>I've already done it for the comments, now I just need to repeat the process for the comment. I'll write out my workflow below and then tackle the rest of this sprint! I'll have to go back to the <a href="https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/homework_create_more_models/">original document</a> I was following because I did not take good notes on it while I was doing the experimental process yesterday.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In <code>forms.py</code> create a <code>PostForm</code> with class meta that relates it to the Post model and had an input of <code>post_text</code>. Make sure to import with <code>import .models Post</code> (I already imported when I imported comment model yesterday) </li>
  <li>Add a line at the top of the <code>dashboard.html</code> for creating new posts</li>
  <li>Create a URLconf for creating post: <code>path('addpost/', views.add_post, name='add_post'</code> </li>
  <li>Create a view that contains the form (may take some trial and error to get right). Make sure to import the correct forms and have the form automatically loads the user and the date/time published</li>
  <li>create an <code>add_post.html</code> in templates </li>
  <li> <strong>Yahoo!</strong> Worked on the first try :D Great feelings. <strong>Sprint 5 complete.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>A note on styling</h3>
<p>I have never used inline styling before - I also have only used internal styling with the style element in the header on the rare occasion of a tutorial where I didn't want to create a linked CSS file. It's always been external for me - the "start with the basics and obey the separations of concerns" camp had won me over.</p>
<p>However, with this application I have started doing inline styling. I have discovered bootstrap is incredibly limited - at least as far as I can tell. If I want to make subtle changes that I can't figure out how to do with bootstrap classes, I just make an inline style. This seems to work out pretty well for me, but I worry I'm getting sloppy. If it gets too out of hand I'll go through and create a CSS file.</p>
<p>Speaking of styling, I think I want to add to my user experience. Here are the things I'm thinking about:</p>

<h2>Styling Improvements:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A navbar that changes whether you are logged in or not</li>
  <li>A "more info" menu that has the following components:
  <ol type="a">
    <li>A short overview of what I've done with this project and why</li>
    <li>Access to these notes to help the IMT team look through the process I took in creating this</li>
    <li>Contact info for me</li>
  </ol>
  <li>A nicer landing page - what do I want it to look like?</li>
</ol>
