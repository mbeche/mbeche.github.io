      This project has been a great experience. Looking at my <strong>notes on this project (available <a href="https://github.com/mbeche/imtwitter-django-app/tree/master/Progress">on GitHub</a> or rendered here on <a href="https://mbeche.github.io/imt/progress.html">this site</a>)</strong> helps me see the progress I've made and how streamlined Django can be. I've had a handful of challenges and implemented some possibly dubious soltuions, but this has been a formidable learning experience. I highlight below these challenges, growth spots, and solutions - noting the important realizations I've had.
    </div></br>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-django-django-2-python-web-dev-website/">Django bootcamp course</a> I took before my interview helped me replicate the project + app startup, but adding user authentication was new. Thankfully Django Documentation, <a href="https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/homework_create_more_models/">many</a> <a href="https://djangobook.com/authentication-web-requests/">upon</a> <a href="http://www.mastercode.online/tutorials/language/tutorial_series/tutorial/how-to-django-blog-application-how-to-edit-post-in-django/">many</a> tutorials, and stackoverflow helped me progress. I also attribute determination, many hours of work, and help from friends to the success of this project.</p>

    <p>Some of the early hurdles were conceputal, like understanding how Django expects content to be lined up: making and extending a base.html file, making URLconfs line up with views, linking to URLconfs in templates, creating models and model forms, and using Django’s included authentication framework.</p>

    <h2>Noteworthy Discoveries</h2>
    <p>Probably the most noteworthy discovery was linking several views to the same template. I was able to have “create”, “edit”, and “delete” post occur all from the same template. I was also able to make the “sort posts”, “search posts” and “Sorry, you can’t edit/delete this post” views all direct to the same template. The possibilities alloted from working within this framework to write DRY code became increasingly evident while I was working on this project (even if this is not clear from looking at the code itself - if only I knew then what I do now).</p>

    <p>While I would have preferred to use automated testing to develop this project (unit tests, integrated tests, and end-to-end tests) I am not certain how to do this or at the very least how to do this effectively. This is one reason I look forward to the prospect of working at IMT - to learn from an experienced team how to implement testing into my coding practice.</p>

    <p>Another notable experience was creating custom views. Creating my post and comment view from my form and model, then routing to the template was fairly straight forward from the tutorials. However, creating my “sort post” and “search post” views kind of looked like this once I got it working:</p>

    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <a href="https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1282394_vVjVM.jpg" target="_blank" style="color: white;"><button class="m-2 btn btn-primary">Me Getting My Sort View Working</button></a>
    </div><br>

    <h2>Sort by User and Search Function</h2>
    <p>Perhaps one of the biggest hate to love relationships that evolved in my heart was using RegEx in my URLconfs to create custom views for sorting. I remember thinking eventually “but where does the view get the information from about what post to access?” I reviewed tutorials, documentation, and followed through my code and the realization washed over me, “The URL itself is giving the view the information from the URLconf!” This helped me extend my "edit/delete" post URLconf to the sort post URLconf.</p>

    <p>For my search feature, I discovered at least 2-3 different ways to make my search feature. I already knew I could use RegEx. I also discovered Django modules and functions that allow searching Postgres databases for keywords. However, in the end I chose to create simple a form in the template that would save the query that could be pulled into my view using a GET protocol. Then I would find posts that include that query and return them to my template.</p>

    <h2>Styling and JavaScript</h2>
    <p>I chose to use a mixture of Bootstrap 4 and CSS for styling this project. To minimize the number of moving parts I chose to use inline CSS to start with (despite the ghost of “separation of concerns” haunting me the whole time). Eventually to make the mobile version of the interface look good I decided I needed to use @media queries and created a CSS file for this.</p>

    <p>I only ventured to use JavaScript for one fix. I decided to use bookmark/anchor tags to redirect you, after interacting with on the post/comment form, to the dashboard at the post/comment you were referencing on the form. The normal functionality would spit you out at the top of the dashboard, requiring you to scroll down again. To get this to work, I used a reverse lookup on my URLconf and concatenated it with the RegEx variable supplied by URL on the form page you were at to edit or create a comment. This felt like a triumph in itself but because the navbar was fixed position, it covered up the top of where the bookmark ID was located, making it appear to be ~50px below where I wanted it to redirect (covering up "Post by ..." header for the post/comment). I found some JS code that would put an event handler on loading the page with bookmark anchor tags and scroll the page in the y-direction a specified amount to fix this. It took some work but I felt that the increase in user experience was worth it.</p>

    <h2>Deploying</h2>
    <p>I’d like to lastly talk about getting my project on DigitalOcean (DO) via <a href="http://imtwitter.mdevstix.com">imtwitter.mdevstix.com</a>. Luckily DO has great tutorials to help with this. This experience gave me practice in creating Postgres databases/users, creating secret files with .gitignore, using Gunicorn and Nginx, and even using Let's Encrypt to make SSL/TLS Certificates. I originally wasn't going ot secure, but I decided to use SSL/TLS because friends and family with iPhones and MacBooks were getting warnings that my site was not trusted. It didn’t mitigate this issue completely, but you can (or should be able to) access my site view <a href="https://imtwitter.mdevstix.com">https://imtwitter.mdevstix.com</a> (if you cannot, please see the <a href="#note">note</a> at the top of the page).</p>

    <p>I came across a couple issues with using Git, GitHub and Postgres while deploying my website. I changed folder names from including uppercase to all lowercase early in my project, but GitHub created two seperate folders with split content because of this. The solution I found was to create new folders and move all my files to the new folder. The issue with Postgres happened when trying to deploy a project with apps already migrated. I received an <a href="https://mbeche.github.io/imt/deploy_error.html"></a>error stating that auth_user was not defined. Troubleshooting did not work for this so I created a new project on my server and imported my apps to that. This fixed the problem, but also required me to create a github repo. This leads me to what was probably the most satisfactory of experiences on this project...</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Making a change on my local server and checking to see how it changed my localhost</li>
      <li>Pushing the changes to github</li>
      <li>Pulling my changes to the server</li>
      <li>Restarting Gunicorn to update the changes</li>
      <li>Refreshing my browser on my computer/phone to see the changes updated on my deployed website</li>
      <li>Repeat</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Creating this project, the hurdles, triumphs and learning it has entailed has been an amazing experience. I hope they are the first of many with IMT computer services!</p>
