    <h1>Error While Deploying</h1>

    <p>I decided to try a local test on whether my project would boot up for you. I created a new DB and copied my project into a new folder. I entered my new DB authentication in settings.py and tested migrate/makemigrations. I expected no errors since migrations had been made before copying. I then received the error below:</p>
    <div class="container">
      <code>django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation "auth_user" does not exist<br>
        LINE 1: ...user"."is_active", "auth_user"."date_joined" FROM "auth_user...</code><br><br>
      </div>
      <p>This is the same error I received when trying to deploy my project online with DigitalOcean.</p>
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <img src="auth_user_error.JPG" alt="Error received when trying to deploy project with a new database">
      </div><br>
      <p>I hope that it's user error and I am forgetting a step to get my database set up correctly when transferring my project to a new DB, but I thought I would throw this note in just in case you came across this issue, too.</p>

      <p>To fix the issue on DigitalOcean, I created a new project, made initial migrations for the user model, and then copyied my app folders over. I also had to change <code>settings.py</code> to add these apps, static file dir, and login/logout redirects.</p>
