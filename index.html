		<h2>My Journey</h2>
		</div>
		<br>
	
					<div class="body-box">
							<h3 align=center>First Passion</h3>
							<p>Back in elementary school, when asked, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
							I would always answer, "a computer programmer." Despite not knowing what that even meant,
							I was transfixed by the tecnological power of computers. My first programming experiences
							were in Middle School, learning how to use HTML to make websites, just for the fun of it.</p>
					</div><br>
						
					<div class="body-box">
						<h3 align=center>Through Graduate Work</h3>
						<p>In my graduate work in Chemical Engineering, I used MatLab to model light as it interacted with
						thin film interfaces. I used it to solve Maxwell's equations involving the coupling of light to electrons
						in the phenomenon called surface plasmon resonance (SPR - the focus of my research). I also used matlab
						array tools and plotting functions to easily handle and present my data in figures.</p>
					</div><br>
				
					<div class="body-box">
						<h3 align=center>Brief Academic History</h3>
						<p>Throughout High School, though, the sciences (first biology, then physics, and finally chemistry)
						stole my heart. Also with a budding love for mathematics and problem solving, I decided
						to pursue biological engineering. The programming course I took to prepare for this degree was Java, 
						however by the time I made it to university from community college, MatLab was the prefered programming
						language for us. Academically, we focused on modeling and solving physical and chemical problems
						involving differential equations. In performing undergraduate research I used MatLab a lot to fit curves
						for data collected by graduate students.</p>
					</div><br>
					
					<div class="body-box">
					<h3 align=center>Growing Up</h3>
						<p>Deciding engineering was not the career path I'd like to pursue, I have spendt the last two years
						teaching science. Having tutored on and off since community college, I am fairly content with my position.
						However, hearing about Python's capabilities and learning about Maching Learning in graduate school,
						I've started learning to code in my off time. This has rekindled my passion to the point of wanting
						to switch careers, thus this website!						
					</div><br>

					<div class="body-box">
						<h2 align=center>What Brought Us Here</h2>
						<p>After surveying jobs in the field, checking out blogs and podcasts, and having discussions with current 
						computer science professionals, I decided to make Web Development my entry point into this field. Below you'll
						find a sampling of projects I've worked on.
